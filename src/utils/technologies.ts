    title: "VITE & REACT",
    p1: "I use React because it's what I enjoy working with — it's flexible, component-based, and just makes sense to me. I chose it as my first JavaScript library after reading recommendations online, and I’ve stuck with it ever since.",
    p2: "Vite has been my go-to dev tool from the start. It’s fast, simple to set up, and gives me instant feedback while building. I’ve always used Vite with React, and I like how smooth the development experience is.",
  },

    id: 2,
    name: "TYPES",
    title: "TYPESCRIPT",
    p1: "I only recently started using TypeScript, and while it took a bit to get used to, it no longer gets in my way. I really like that even the smallest mistakes I might’ve missed before now get caught early. Writing a bit of extra code up front pays off in the long run.",
  },

    id: 2,
    name: "STYLES",
    title: "TAILWIND & FRAMER MOTION",
    p1: "I like Tailwind for its inline utility classes — styles are easy to read right where I write my markup. No more jumping between files or hunting for class names, plus autocomplete speeds things up. The huge library of pre-styled classes means I can build quickly without reinventing the wheel.",
    p2: "Framer Motion is my go-to for animations because it’s simple and intuitive. Animations live inside the component, so everything stays organized and easy to understand.",
  },

    id: 2,
    name: "ROUTING",
    title: "REACT ROUTER",
    p1: "React Router just works for me — it’s simple and reliable. Managing navigation and page changes is easy, and since so many people use it, there’s always tons of help and examples when I get stuck. I haven’t really tried other options yet, but for now, it’s the go-to router that gets the job done without any hassle.",
  },

    id: 2,
    name: "DATA",
    title: "REACT QUERY",
    p1: "I like React Query because it makes fetching and managing server data way easier. It handles all the tricky stuff like loading states, caching, and updating data in the background — so I don’t have to stress about it. It just works smoothly and helps keep my app fast and responsive without much extra effort.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: "STATE",
    title: "ZUSTAND",
    p1: "I picked Zustand over Redux because I wanted something cleaner and easier to manage my state with. So far, it’s been great and hasn’t caused any problems. That said, I’d probably learn and use Redux for bigger projects since it’s more widely recommended.",
